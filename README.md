Welcome to StatFlow_EDA_APP, a web application built using Streamlit, Pandas Profiling, and Python. This app is designed to provide you with a new and efficient way to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). With StatFlow, you can easily visualize your data and conduct statistical analysis, gaining valuable insights to make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Visualization:** StatFlow_EDA_APP allows you to interactively explore your data using various charts, including line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more. Visualizing data patterns and relationships has never been easier!

- **Statistical Analysis:** Perform a wide range of statistical analysis on your dataset, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and inferential statistics. StatFlow_EDA_APP aims to make complex statistical procedures accessible to everyone.

- **Pandas Profiling Report:** Leveraging the power of Pandas Profiling, StatFlow_EDA_APP automatically generates a comprehensive report that provides a detailed overview of your data. This report includes summary statistics, data types, missing value analysis, and more, helping you to better understand your dataset quickly.

## Getting Started

To use StatFlow_EDA_APP, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install streamlit pandas-profiling`.

2. Clone the StatFlow_EDA_APP repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the project directory and run the app using the following command: `streamlit run app.py`.

4. Once the app is running, you can upload your dataset in CSV format or any other compatible format.

5. Explore your data by selecting variables and visualizations of interest.

6. Utilize the generated Pandas Profiling report to get an in-depth understanding of your dataset.
